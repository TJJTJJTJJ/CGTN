Fried getting suntan   
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand

Eaten by a lion

Help me help me  
I'm no good at goodbye

Drown in a hot hub  热水桶  
Danced to death at an east side night club  
Help me, help me.  
I'm all out of lies  
And ways to say you died  
I wanna live a thousand lives with you  
I wanna be the one you're dying to   
Love  
but you don't want to  
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
