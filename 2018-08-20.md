China-US Trade Tensions: Trump threatens another $200 bln worth of tariffs on Chinese imports
daily-used consumer goods are not likely to be spared as before. 像之前一样幸免
will get hit with duties as high as 25%.
Mandarin 普通话

We started in Washington, DC, where business owners have ended a fifth day of lobbying US government for and against more tariffs on China. U.S President Trump is threatening more duties on another 200 billion dollars ~~worth~~ of Chinses imports.This time, daily-used consumer good are not likely _to be_ spared as before.

At the end of a week of conflicitng signals about _the_ U.S. ~~and~~ China trade war, business owners and ~~lobbies~~ _lobbyists_ spend a fifth day _telling_ Trump administration how _another_ 200 billion dollars _of_ tarrifs on ~~China~~ Chinese imports would affect them.

If ~~they would~~ _they're_ imposed, possibly _in_ late ~~at~~ September, some Chinese imports, such as Mandarin oranges, would be hit with duties as high as 25%.

25% is extremely high, and because Mandarin business is a very low margin, and 25% is maybe a kill, damage the business.

And Trump administration is pressuring China into changing what Washington considered unfair trade practices that threaten the American job and economy. China denied this.

The U.S. and China have already hit each other with duties ~~of~~ _on_ 50 billion dollars worth of each other goods. So far, they have been careful to spark human products, but next round pentensional US wouldn't.

And a new study from US national ~~retired~~ _retail_ federation ~~such~~ says consumers ~~can consume~~ would pay billions of dollars more for ~~lugage and funitrate~~ luggage and furniture  alone if those duties are imposed.
