## This is Conan 4
This is **delicious**.  
I just love eating dinner **as** a family.  
Oh, please.  
You haven't eating with us in weeks.  
Plus, the **pot roast** is cold.炖肉:红烧肉  
because we had to wait 15 minutes for you to come downstairs for dinner.  
Here we go.又来了,又是老一套.  
Abby, can you pass the salt, please?  
Whoa!  
What was that all about? I asked you to pass the salt, **not the attitude**.  
That's rich.那真是太棒了，真实太荒谬了:戏真足   
Come on, dad.  
Come on, what is this about?怎么回事
What is this about? I found this in your dressing room. Who the hell is Rebecca.  
She's nobody, I can explain.  
**Are you seeing** another sidekick?助手,好友,朋友:捧哏 你是不是正在看另一个伙伴:你是不是又找了一个捧哏  
Another sidekick? Wait a minute, no. 
Yeah, that's crazy.  
Yo do have another sidekick. You son of a bitch.  
I'm not his sidekick. We're just having sex.  
Quiet, Rebecca. **You're not helping**.  别火上浇油了.  
Screw this. 见鬼去吧  
You two are always fighting.  
Get back here. We are eating dinner as a family.  
No. We're are going to where our real family is. Hometown buffet.  
We stopped being a family a long time ago.  
Don't worry about them, **they'll** be back when they need money.  
Ha. Good one, Boss. 说得好.  
In the name of God, Rebecca. shut up 看在上帝的份上  
Oh, it's all ruined.  
I miss the dinner we used to have. I missed us.  
Andy, don't you see? This is us.
