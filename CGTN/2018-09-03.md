# conan  
There's a super popular manga and anima character(动漫和漫画人物) in Japan whose name is Detective Conan.  
Ladies and gentleman, Detective Conan is a man who is trapped in child's body and solves crimes. __Sound a little familiar?__(此处有连读，sound little familiar).  
Now, I've established that(我之前讲过了) Detective Conan is clearly a rip-off(仿制品，偷窃，  要价太高) of yours truly.    
Detective Conan was created in 1994, that's a year after I went on the air(上节目，节目开播), to instant international acclaim(国际赞誉).     
Now, clearly, you have to be a genius to see someone has been making a lot of money off the Conan name.
The attorney. Absolutely, it's an open and shut case. 一目了然   
finally I got a  sidekick(死党 搭档) that listens to me.  
So, the other night, I reasonably(合理地) asked Japan to pay me three trillion yen.    
I asked the mayor of Conan Town to change the name of the town's most popular coin laundry. 自助洗衣店    
to something a little more iconic and recognizable around the world. 更具标志性、举世闻名的发型    
The plot thickens. 情况变复杂了  好戏还在后头   
Be here or be square 如果受邀方没有赴约 那人太无趣了    
Don't mess with this guy.  不要惹上这家伙 卷入有害的事 与某人有牵连   
You're a very shrewd negotiator.精明的谈判者     
Mount Rushmore 拉什莫尔山  
Hollywood Walk of Fame 好莱坞星光大道  
 one for every resident of Conan Town. 居民    
some like them well-down 有些想要全熟    
This  steer will be parachuted into Conan town.  牛  降落  空投    
Now it's time for me to call your bluff.  该到你摊牌的时候了  虚张声势
