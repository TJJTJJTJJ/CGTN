## Title

**The rise and fall** of Christmas music

* the rise and fall 兴衰史

## para1

Christmas music as we know it was born in 1963, when Phil Spector **corralled his stable of singers into the studio** to record “A Christmas Gift For You From Phil Spector”. Until then, there had only been **schmaltzy carols** and **easy listening staples**, with **occasional hints of a party tune**.

* corralle
* * corralle sb into sp. 把某个群体聚集在某地
* stable = a groups of people who work for a same company 在同一家公司工作的人; 同一个系列
* * actors from same Hollyhood stable 同一个好莱坞的演员
* his stable of singers 同一家唱片公司旗下的艺人
* schmaltzy 过度煽情的节目等
* carol 宗教节日唱的颂歌等等
* * a Christmas carol 圣诞歌
* easy listening 轻松的音乐
* staple 主要产品
* easy listening staple 轻松舒缓的主打歌
* hint = a small amount 少量
* * a hint of smile 一抹微笑
* party 派对气氛的，欢乐的
* party tune 欢乐的旋律
* occasional hints of a party tune 偶尔有一些欢乐的旋律

## para2

Mr Spector made the first Christmas album that managed to be both thrilling and **seasonal**. It sounded like the Christmas party, not the **snooze** after Christmas dinner. So these days you can find **heavy metal Christmas albums, funk Christmas albums and punk Christmas albums**.

* thrilling 激动人心的
* seasonal 季节性的，此处引申为圣诞节气氛的
* snooze 打盹
* heavy metal 重金属
* funk 乡村爵士乐
* punk 摇滚乐，朋克

## para3

Britain has **embraced** the Christmas single: between 1974 and 1990, nine of the number ones on Christmas Day were explicitly festive records. In America, meanwhile, there has never been a seasonal song at number one at Christmas in the Billboard Hot 100. Perhaps the Christmas single has **lost some of its lustre**.

* embrace 广受欢迎
* seasonal = festive
* lustre 光泽；光荣，荣耀
* * golds retains lustre for far longer than other metals
* * add lustre to 增加光彩

## para4

Yet the Christmas album remains a **regular feature** on the **release schedule of major artists**. This year, for example, there is one album called “Christmas Party” from the Monkees. The people they aim at are middle-aged, trying to recreate their old Christmases of Slade or the Pogues.

* regular feature 固有特色
* release schedule 发布日程
* 圣诞专辑的发布仍然是主流艺人日程安排表的常规计划

## para5

In a sense, then, Christmas records have returned to their pre-Spector purpose. Forget the teenagers: they’re in their bedrooms on Spotify, YouTube or Netflix. But in the living room, the adults have pulled on the Christmas sweaters and poured the egg nog. Now, what will it be, Bing Crosby or Eric Clapton?

* then 上段和这段的连接词，表示得出一个结论
* Spotify 音乐服务平台，类似虾米音乐等
* Netflix 视频网站
* pull on 穿上
* pour 倒
* egg nog 蛋奶酒

"**Educated**, " by Tara Westover (Random House). I never thought I'd relate to a story about growing up in a Mormon **survivalist** household, but Tara Westover is such a good writer that she got me to **reflect on** my own life while reading about her extreme childhood.

## Title

After a **petition** called Gandhi '**racist**,' his **statue** was removed from the University of Ghana.

* petition 请愿
* * petition someone to do sth
* racist n.种族主义者;adj. 种族主义的
* statue 雕像

## para1

Another **marker** has been **felled** in the **intense argument** over whether **historic figures with racist histories** should be honored. The University of Ghana in Accra no longer has a statue of India **independence leader** Mohandas K. Gandhi.

* fell 伐木；引申为打倒
* marker 标识
* intense argument 激烈争论
* historic figures with racist histories 具有种族主义色彩的历史人物
* independence leader 独立领袖

## para2

Gandhi's Indian **empowerment argument**, critics said in a petition to remove the statue, appeared to be that the British colonial government treated Indians a "little better, **if at all**, than the **savages** or the Natives of Africa." He spoke of the "**half-heathen Native**" and said that treating Indians like Africans would "**degrade** us." The **sole occupation** of "**raw**" natives is hunting, he said and their "**sole ambition** is to **collect a certain number of cattle** to buy a wife with and, then, pass his life in **indolence** and **nakedness**."

* empowerment 授权；增强xx的信心
* * movement to empower individuals 旨在增强个人信心的运动

* indolent 懒散的
* nakedness 赤裸裸的

## para3

Critics argue that Gandhi's thoughts about Africans shouldn't be **whitewashed** by history—that no one's flaws should **be immune from** **historical scrutiny**. Christopher Columbus "discovered" the Americas, —then killed and enslaved the people who already lived there. Many of America's Founding Fathers owned slaves. Martin Luther King Jr. **cheated on** his wife. And for members of the University of Ghana council who started the petition in 2016 and the more than 2, 200 people had signed it since, a statue to Gandhi **had no place** on campus.

* whitewash 洗白，粉饰
* be immune from 不受xx的影响

Why **life expectancy** in America is down again

* expentancy 期待
* life expectancy 预期寿命

## para1

Overall **life expectancy** in America fell **fractionally** in 2017, from 78.7 to 78.6 years, according to data published recently by the US Centres for Disease Control. **Underlying** the drop was a bad year for **influenza** and a slight increase in the **toll** of **Alzheimer’s disease**. But more significant was an increase in suicides and **overdoses**, which added 2.4 more deaths per 100, 000 Americans.

* fraction 分数；一小部分

Over the longer term, suicide rates are now **at a historical high**, but only a little higher than they were in 1950. But drug-overdose rates, which **were well below** five per 100, 000 people between 1950 and 1990, climbed above that rate **by the turn of the century**, and then **spiked** dramatically, reaching above 20 deaths per 100, 000 in 2017.

* at a historical high 历史最高点

* climb = to go up or go to the torwards top of sth = rise

* spike = to rise to a high amount usually before going down again上升到了某一个最高点然后下降

## para4

Christopher Ruhm, an economist at the University of Virginia, **points to the importance of** public health efforts to control the **opioid epidemic**. The recent experience of Dayton, Ohio **backs him up**: over the past year, opioid deaths have more than **halved**. Public health experts **attribute that to** a combination of Medicaid expansion; declining street availability of some of the most addictive opioids; and **post-treatment** support for recovering addicts.

* point to the importance of sth 指出某事的重要性
* opioid 类鸦片
* epidemic (疾病的)流行；泛滥
* back sb. up 支持，帮助某人；为某人作证
* halve 对半分

Seriously, Prada, what were you thinking? Why the fashion industry **keeps bumbling into racist imagery**

* bumble 笨手笨脚、跌跌撞撞
* * stumble 绊倒，
* * tumble 跌倒
* imagery 意象；设计或者造型
* bumble into racist imagery 频频跌入种族歧视设计的泥潭
* keeps bumbling into racist imagery 老是给人一种种族歧视的形象

**备注**：

此处的 imagery 主要指一种形象、意象，是某物引发了某种意境，racist imagery 每当谈论起种族主义，给出的具体的形象化的例子，这里指每当谈论起种族主义，就很容易拿出时尚行业发生的事情当例子。或者说时尚行业的一些事情容易触碰到反种族主义者的神经，让人联想到种族主义者。

> 时尚行业发生的一些事情，很容易让反种族歧视主义者联想到种族主义。

bumble into 是一种修辞手法

## para1

A display of expensive **tchotchkes** in the **windows** of Prada's Soho **boutique** in **downtown** New York included one style that **recalled** a Golliwog, the 19th century blackface character with big round eyes and large red lips. The thing also **resembled** **the title character** from "Little Black Sambo, " a children's book of the same era. Either way, the **connotations** were **unequivocally** racist.

* tchotchke 小挂件
* windows 橱窗
* boutique 精品店
* downtown 市中心
* recall 回忆，使人联想起
* resemble 形似，类似

## para2

After complaints from the public, the Prada Group issued an apology, **dismantled** the display and announced that it would **pull the offending $550 charm from circulation**. "They are **imaginary** creatures not intended to have any reference to the real world and certainly not blackface. Prada Group never had the intention of offending anyone and we **abhor** all forms of racism and racist **imagery**, " the company said in a statement.

* dismantle 拆除；废除
* pull from circulation 下架

## para3

Fashion companies **are fluent in the language of marketing**. Designers are savants of the visual arts. But both often lack the ability to see beyond the surface—beyond **the sales pitch** and the **color palette**—to get at the complex humanity of people. They continue to see everything from their own singular **point-of-view**. **To some degree**, that is their job. They digest **a bounty of** inspiration. And they create something personal and **proprietary**.

* be fluent in the language of sth 通晓某种事物的语言，游刃有余
* savant 深谙，专家
* pitch 宣传的用语
* sale pitch 广告文案
* paleette 调色板
* proprietary 专有的，专利
* property 财产
* a bounty of 大量

## para4

That's an explanation, however, not an excuse. Globalism demands allowing more voices—more diverse voices—into the creative process and into the decision-making equation.

* equation = process
* decision-making equation 决策过程中对于不同意见的权衡
* take sth into equation 把xx纳入考虑权衡中

## para4

The ASA’s Ella Smillie, who helped to **devise** the new rules, said: “We don’t see ourselves as social engineers, we’re reflecting the changing standards in society. Changing ad regulation isn’t going to end gender inequality but we know advertising can reinforce harmful gender stereotypes, which can limit people’s choices or potential in life.”

* devise 设计，发明
