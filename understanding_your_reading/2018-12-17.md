"My life is not your porn, " read one poster. "We should be able to live, not survive, " declared another. The women **brandishing them** in the centre of Seoul wore red clothes and large sunglasses. They had covered their heads with baseball caps or **broad-brimmed hats**. The headgear and glasses serve mainly to make the protesters unrecognisable to men who might be hostile **to their cause**: the fight against molka, videos which are filmed using cameras hidden in public toilets, school changing rooms or even women's homes, and then posted on the Internet.

In terms of appearance and behaviour, **women and men are held to wildly different standards**. A YouTube star who used her make-up tutorial channel to announce that she was giving up make-up to join the "corset-free" movement, which challenges unrealistic beauty standards, received a torrent of online threats.

## Title

Surveying China's livestreaming economy

* survey 审视;调查
* live streaming 直播

## para1

What was once a niche subculture has evolved into a $5bn business in China. In 2016 nearly half the country’s internet users watched a livestream. “People’s Republic of Desire”, a documentary directed by Hao Wu, reveals the strange machinations of an online world where people can fulfil their most basic social needs.

* niche 利基市场,针对企业的优势细分出来的市场,指被大企业忽略的市场.

* niche subculture 利基次文化

* machination against other board members 反对理事会成员的密谋
* strange machinations of an online world 网络世界不寻常的套路
*　machine 机器
* fulfil oneself 自我满足

## para2

The livestreamers themselves are usually poorly educated and unemployed: they perform online **in hope of** quick fame and fortune. Big Li migrated from Hubei to Beijing to work as a security guard, before striking it rich livestreaming full-time.

* poorly educated
* quick fame and fortune 一夜成名,赚笔快钱
* security guard 保安
* striking it rich doing sth 发横财

## para3

At the heart of the film, then, is a familiar story. Livestreaming started off full of creative, entrepreneurial and democratic potential but has since taken on a dystopian feel. Everybody can participate in the competition for clicks, views and tips in China’s attention economy, but the platform dictates the rules of the game. “I was fascinated by how a single platform could profit from rich and poor alike, ” Mr Hao tells The Economist. Before pursuing film-making, Mr Hao worked at Alibaba and Yahoo, two internet companies, and he says he is sensitive to the ways in which users can be manipulated for profit.

* then 另起一个话题
* at the heart of the film 这部记录片的核心
* entrepreneurial 创业的;进取的
* entrepreneur 企业家
* take on a feel 带有某种感觉
* dystopian 反乌托邦
* dictate 支配;规定

## para4

His thought-provoking film reveals a bitter irony not limited to livestreaming: that the connection that technology was meant to provide has isolated people, too. Big Li’s family begins to fall apart. “I miss my son, ” he confesses in one scene, breaking down in tears in front of millions of his fans. He turns away, as if finally realising that the faceless, flickering icons on his computer screen will not give him what he longs for.

* thought-provoking 发人深省的
* bitter 令人痛苦的,难以接受的,此处译为苦涩的
* irony 讽刺的
* fall apart 解体,崩溃
*　* marriage fall apart 婚姻崩溃
* * fall apart to piece
* break down 崩溃,感情失控
* flickering 闪烁的

## para2

The event was **the single greatest calamity** ever to **befall life** on Earth, **eclipsing** even the extinction of the dinosaurs 65m years ago. Up to 96% of all marine species **perished** while more than two-thirds of **terrestrial species** disappeared.

The researchers built a model to analyse changes in animal **metabolism**, ocean and climate conditions. They found that marine animals essentially **suffocated** as warming waters lacked the oxygen required for survival. “For the first time, we’ve got** a whole lot of confidence** that this is what happened, ” said Deutsch, an **oceanography** expert who co-authored the research. “It’s a very **strong argument** that rising temperatures and oxygen depletion **were to blame**.”

“**The past holds the key to the future**, ” said Pamela Grothe, a paleoclimate scientist at the University of Mary Washington. “If we continue in the **trajectory we are on** with current emission rates, this study highlights the potential that we may see similar rates of extinction in marine species as in the end of the Permian.”
