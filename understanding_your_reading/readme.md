### original

Silicon Valley nannies are phone police for kids.
Silicon Valley parents are increasingly obsessed with keeping their chirldren away from screens. Even a little screen time can be so deeply addictive, some parents believe, that **it's best if** a child neither touches nor sees any of glittering rectangles. These particular parents, after all, deepply understand their allure.
But it's very hard for a woking adult in the 21st century to live at home without looking at a phone. And so, *as with many* aspirations and ideals, it's easier to hire someone to do this.
Enter the Silicon Valley nanny, who each day returns to the time before screens.
From Cupertino to San Francisco, **a growing consensus has emerged** that screen time is bad for kids. It follows that these parents are now asking nannies to keep phones, tablets, computers and TVs off and hidden at all times. Some are even producing no phone contracts, **which guarantee zero unauthorized screen exposure** for their nannies to sign.
The fear of screen has reached the level of panic in Silicon Valley. Vigilantes now post photos to parenting message boards of possible nannies using cellphone near children. Which is to say, the very people building thees **glowing hyper-stimulating portals** have become increasingly terrified of them. And it has put their nannies in a strange position.
Most parents come home and they're still glued to their phones and they're not listening to a word these kids are saying. Now I am the nanny ripping out the cords from the PlayStations.

A 15-year-old 15 pages resume captivates China.
The young applicant is described as confident and courageous. His resume, at 15 pages, is glittering, **complete with** performance reviews(full of energy), a map of his travels(trips to Tokyo and Bali), and a list of books he has read this year(408 in total).It includes discussion of his adversity quotient and his artistic talents. But the applicant is not a seasoned job seeker, he is 5 years old boy from southern China, applying for the spot in first grade at a Shanghai private school.
The resume, which was leaked and shared widely online this week, has provoked a mix of fascination, indignation and debate about whether children in China's **test-crazed education system** are being raised as **soulless strivers**.
Some called for the parents of the boy to be arrested. Others wondered whether today's children would know true happiness given the intense pressure to preform well and **land good jobs**. Still, some defended the parents, saying they were trying to promote their child's best interests in a flawed system.
Yong Zhao, a professor of education at the University of Kansas, said the debate reflected **widespreading anxiety** among Chinese parents about getting their children into top schools. In China's test-dominated system, exam scores determine where students go to college and what carrers they can pursue.
Xiong Bingqi, **deputy head** of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing, said China needed to distribute education resources more evenly and to begin evaluating students on more than just test scores.
"There's a competion to rank every student", he said, "Under thees circumstrances, of course parents want their kids to rank in the top, then it worsens this kind of anxious competition "

Stan Lee obituary
The comic book writer Stan Lee, who has died aged 95, revolutionised his industry in the 1960s, when he created the **mythic figures**, that are still inspiring new generaions to **flock to the cinema**. Lee's creations, the X-man, Fantastic Four, most of the avengers... helped to **rescue the costumed superhero from obscurity** and **to usher in the silver age of American comic books.
But it was a radioactive spider that was responsible for Lee's most popular creation. To many, Spider-Man was not about fighting **malformed or transmuted** enemies such as the Green Goblin or the Lizard , but about Peter Parker, a shy, bullied young boy with **a  crush on a beautiful girl** from his school, but who lacks the confidence to ask her out.
Lee was allowed to give his character flaws, and where superheros had previously immediately **embraced his power**, his heroes were often reluctant. Lee **gave his characters voices**, with **pithy catchphrases**--"Flame on!", "Hulk smash", "It's collering' time", and pages **litterd with** thought balloons out of which would grow some truth that the hero needed to learn, **not the least** of which Peter Parker's:'with great power, there must also come great responsibility'
In a 1965 Esquire poll, Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk were ranked alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as the favorite revolutionary icons among college students. Lee once said,"Our goal is that someday an intelligent adult would not be embarrassed to walk down the street with a comic magazine, I don't know whether we can ever **bring this off**, but it's something to shout for"

### origin

Donald Trump's **unconstitutional** dreams
In an interview with the news program "Axios on HBO", President Donald Trump announced that he plans to issue an **executive order** ending **birthright citizenship**, the principle that everyone born in the United States, with a handful of exceptions, is automatically a citizen of the United States.
"It was always told to me", The president declared, "that you needed a **constitutional amendment**, guess what, you don't"
In fact, such order would undoubtedly be unconsitutional. It would also violate a deeply root American idea--that anybody regradless of race, religion, national origin, or the legal status of one's parents, can be a loyal citizen of this country.
Birthright citizenship is established by the Civil Rights Act of 1866, still **on the books** today, and by the Fourteen Amendment to the constitution, ratified two years later. Adopted as part of the effort to purge the United States of the legacy of slavery, the principle of birthright citizenship remains an eloquent statement about the nature of American society, a powerful force for assimilation of the children of immigrants, and a repudiation of our long history of racism.
Trump's prospective order would deny citizenship to children born in the United States to uncitizens. It is especially aimed at undocumented immigrants who supposedly pour into the country to have anchor babies, one of the president's numerous exaggeraions, when it comes to the dangers posed by immigration.
Trump' oreder, if issued, will not noly violate both the Constitution and deeply rooted American ideals, but also **set a dangerous precedent**. If president can unilaterally **abrogate a provision of the Constitution** by executive order, which one wiil be next?

### para1

In their largely **unprocessed** forms, foods from earth, trees or animals are healthful by definition. So, why, you might ask, would the producers of foods, such as cranberries, pears, avocados, or walnuts, **fund research** aimed at proving that these particular foods, rather than fruits, vegetables, and nuts in general, have special health benefits? Marketing, of course, every food producer wants to expand sales, **Health claims** sell.

**All of this** explains why Royal Hawaian Macadamia Nut **petitioned** the FDA in 2015 to allow it to say in advertisement that daily consumption of macadamias-along with eating a healthy diet-may reduce the risk of heart disease. The 81-page petition **cited** several studies done in humans, one of them funded by the Hershey Company, which selles the chocolate covered macadamias.

The FDA ruled that it would permit **a qualified healthy claim** for macadamia nuts with this **precise wording**:**Supportive but not conclusive research** shows that eating 1.5 ounces per day of macadamia nuts as part of a diet low in **saturated fat** and cholesterol, and not resuling in increased **intake of** saturated fat or calories may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.

But what is wrong with promoting the benefits of healthful foods?

It wasn't that the programme was **malevolently misogynistic**. Rather like all AI programs, it had to be trained by being fed data **what constitued good results**. Amazon, naturally, fed it with details of its **recruitment programme** over the previously ten years, Most applicants had been man, as had most recruits. What the program learned, was that men, not women, were good candidates.

It's not the first time that AI programs have been shown to **exhibit** bias.

### para5,6,7

**All this** should teach us three things. First, the issue here **is not to do with AI itself**, but with social practices. The biases are in real life. Second, **the problem with AI arises**, when we think of machine as being objective. A machine is only as good as humans programming it. And third, **while there are** many circumstances in which machines are better, especially where speed is **paramount**, we have a sense of right and wrong, and social means of challenging bias and injustice, we should never deprecate that.

The news never sleeps, and neither do the two new anchors at China's state run news agency.
The Xinhua news just unveiled what it's calling the world's first news anchors powered by the artificial intelligence at the World Internet Conference Wednesday in China's Zhejiang province. From the outside, they are almost indistinguishale from their human counterparts, crisp-sutied and tidy-haired. While Xinhua says the anchors have the voice, facial expressions and actions of a real person. The robotic anchors relay whatever text is fed to them, in stilted speech, that sounds less human than Siri or Alexa.

Developed jointly by Xinhua News and Chinese search engine company Sogou.com, the anchors learn from live broadcasting videos and social media and can work 24 hours a day.
The AI anchors are both modeled off real jounalists at the agency, and perform some basic human expressions, like blinking and raising their eyebrows, they can be endless copied, according to the debut video, thus able to cover stories at multiple locations at once.
Although the AI anchors are inexhaustible, they're void of decision-making and processing skills, and can't offer the emotional element given by a real journalist.
As an AI news anchors are under devolopment, by now there are a lot for me to improve, the English speaking anchor said in his first sign off.
